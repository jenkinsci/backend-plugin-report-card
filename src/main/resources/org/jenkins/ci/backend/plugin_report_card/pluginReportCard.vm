h2. Why?

This page attempts to draw attention to Jenkins plug-ins which require an old, sometimes *very* old, version of Jenkins -- this is known to developers as the 'Required Core'. Having lots of disparate required core versions makes it painful for developers to fix bugs in lots of plug-ins concurrently because Maven will suffer from "download the internet" syndrome due to the multitude of dependencies required to make Jenkins function.

Therefore it is in the interest of both developers and users to rally around specific versions of the core.. and hence, this automated page. 

\\

h2. Charts

To help visualize how disparate the required core versions are, here is a graph which depicts the total number of plugins at each required core version. The chart ranges on the x-axis from 1.300 to 1.500.

\\

{chart:title=Distribution|type=bar|width=800}
|| Required Core ||#foreach( ${requiredCore} in ${requiredCores} ) $!{requiredCore.name} ||#end

|| Total Plugins |#foreach( ${requiredCore} in ${requiredCores} ) $!{requiredCore.count} |#end
{chart}

\\

h2. Plugin Required Core Data

\\

|| Required Core || Group Id || Artifact Id || Version || SCM ||
#foreach( ${plugin} in ${plugins} )
| $!{plugin.parentVersion} | $!{plugin.effectiveGroupId} | $!{plugin.effectiveArtifactId} | $!{plugin.effectiveVersion} | [$!{plugin.repositoryUrl}] |
#end
